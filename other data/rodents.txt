In this assignment, we will get more practice with time series inference using GLS and ARIMA models. This lab is graded on completion - just make sure you turn something in by 11/27. 

For this lab, we will focus on small rodent abundance and rainfall data in Chile. From a rather interesting paper[^1]:

> Rodent outbreaks or irruptions in semiarid Chile are associated with rainfall pulses driven by the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the last decade, north-central Chile has experienced an almost uninterrupted sequence of dry years, the so-called megadrought, which had led to a new ecological situation in this region. We employ a diagnostic approach to analyze the abundance of data regarding two rodent species, Phyllotis darwini and Abrothrix olivacea, using a 33-yr time series spanning from 1987 to 2019. Our population dynamic models provide evidence of competitive interactions within and among both species of rodents. This result is novel since rainfall variability influences the degree of interspecific competition and is asymmetric. The diagnostic approach used here offers a way to develop simple population models that are useful for understanding the causes of population fluctuations and for predicting population changes under a climate change scenario. 

Here is a bit of information about each column from the metadata:

- `PD` = Phyllotis darwini minimun number alive
- `PDD` = Phyllotis darwini density (minimun number alive/trapping area)
- `XPD` = natural logarithm of P. darwini density
- `AO` = Abrothrix olivacea minimun number alive
- `AOD` = Abrothrix olivacea density (minimun number alive/trapping area)
- `XAO` = natural logarithm of Abrothrix olivacea density
- `RPD` = logarithmic (per capita) reproductive rate of Phyllotis darwini
- `RAO` = logarithmic (per capita) reproductive rate of Abrothrix olivacea
- `P` = Annual accumulated rainfall (mm)
- `P1` = one year lagged annual accumulated rainfall (mm)
