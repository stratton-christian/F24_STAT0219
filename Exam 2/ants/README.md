Using an RFID tag system (SK-Electronics CO., Ltd., Japan), we obtained the count data for five colonies of ants, Camponotus japonicus, collected from the Higashi-Hiroshima campus of Hiroshima University. The colonies A, B, and C contained a queen ant, but the others, D and E, were without one. For each colony, almost 150 workers attached the RFID tag on their thoraxes with resin glue (Kiyohara UVR, KIYOHARA &amp; Co., Ltd.) without exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>. The observation started one week after the workers attached RFID tags to avoid observing the adjustment state of workers. The RFID reader was installed on the tube's roof, connecting each colony's nest chamber and the foraging arena.

## Description of the data and file structure

There are five CSV files corresponding to each colony's name described above. The first column is an index of workers in a colony, and the first rows after the second column represent the day observed count data for each worker. The other cells at the ith row and the jth column represent the count data of the ith worker on the jth day.
